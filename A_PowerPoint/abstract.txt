Purpose

This paper analyzes how novices and experts can safely adapt and transfer their skills to new technology in the medical domain.

Methods

To answer this question, we compared the performance of 12 novices (medical students) with the performance of 12 laparoscopic surgeons (using a 2D view) and 4 robotic surgeons, using a new robotic system that allows 2D and 3D view.

Results

Our results showed a trivial effect of expertise (surgeons generally performed better than novices). Results also revealed that experts have adaptive transfer capacities and are able to transfer their skills independently of the human-machine system. However, the expert’s performance may be disturbed by changes in their usual environment.

Implications

From a safety perspective, this study emphasizes the need to take into account the impact of these environmental changes along with the expert’s adaptive capacities.
